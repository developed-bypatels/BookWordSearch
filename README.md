# BookWordSearch
Program will count words in a text file. In addition to counting words it also spell checks the document and report how many words are not found in the provided dictionary. Uses a class, BookWord, to store each word. The words must be stored without concern for case sensitivity. A word is considered to be one or more characters in length separated by white space (space character, the new line character). Commas, periods, exclamation points, question marks and quotes may appear in the document but these must be ignored and not included as part of the word.
